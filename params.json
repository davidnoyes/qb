  "body": "# qb\r\nqb (pronounced \"*cube*\") is a cross-platform toolkit for **system containers** inspired by the **application container** stack by Docker.\r\n\r\n### Why not Docker?\r\n```docker``` is great, we love it, but it's not suitable for everything. Docker is an **application container** technology, meaning it's intended to wrap a single process such as Apache, Nginx or MySQL. However, not everyone is in the position to adopt a micro-service infrastructure. Perhaps you have legacy systems to support, maybe you rely on other services a full system would provide such as systemd, cron or syslog. In these cases you either simply can't use Docker at all, or you have to hack it to work in a way in which it was never intended to be used, which can cause buggy behaviour.\r\n\r\n```qb``` provides Docker-like functionality but is different in that it utilises **system containers**, meaning you don't need to choose a single process to wrap, the container boots all of the services you'd expect from a regular Linux distribution.\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n#### qb machine\r\nVagrant\r\n\r\n#### qb container\r\nLXD\r\n\r\n#### qb registry\r\nLXD Image Store\r\n\r\n#### qb network\r\nFlannel\r\n\r\n#### qb compose\r\nAnsible\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nTODO\r\n```bash\r\nqb --help\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Contribute\r\nAs always, we welcome **pull requests** with open arms.
