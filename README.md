# qb
qb (pronounced "cube") is a cross-platform toolkit for system containers inspired by the application container stack by Docker.

## Why not Docker?
Docker is great, we love it, but it's not suitable for everything. Docker is an "application container" technology, meaning it's intended to wrap a single process such as Apache, Nginx or MySQL. However, not everyone is in the position to adopt a micro-service infrastructure. Perhaps you have legacy systems to support, maybe you rely on other services a full system provides such as Crontab or Systemd. In these cases you either simply can't use Docker at all, or you have to hack it to work in a way in which it was never intended to be used, which can cause buggy behaviour.
